## Project Description

This project will focus on training a neural network (NN) for the task of generating music. [This article](ttps://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-for-music-generation-97c983b50204) inspired the idea and outlines several different types of approaches that have been used before.
For example, one of these is by using Reinforcement Learning. The plan would be to teach the model to "follow certain rules, while still allowing it to retain information learned from data." Approaches completed before have used LSTM models, or Long short-term memory (LSTM) models. This is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. According to research, "LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series." 

## Goals 

A fun result of this project would be if the NN were able to create its own piece of music. Past popular projects have also molded this into a tool of music creators to use alongside their usual music creation process.
